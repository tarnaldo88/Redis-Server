#Common Commands
*PING*
Use case: Before embarking on any data operations, an application can send a PING to ensure that the Redis server is alive and responsiveâ€”like knocking on a door before entering.

*ECHO*
Use case: A debugging tool or simple utility to test network connectivity by having the server repeat a message. It can also be used in logging systems to trace commands.

*FLUSHALL*
Use case: When resetting a cache or starting fresh, FLUSHALL clears all stored keys. This is useful during development or when you need to wipe out stale data completely.
