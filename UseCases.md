##Common Commands
*PING*
Use case: Before embarking on any data operations, an application can send a PING to ensure that the Redis server is alive and responsive—like knocking on a door before entering.

*ECHO*
Use case: A debugging tool or simple utility to test network connectivity by having the server repeat a message. It can also be used in logging systems to trace commands.

*FLUSHALL*
Use case: When resetting a cache or starting fresh, FLUSHALL clears all stored keys. This is useful during development or when you need to wipe out stale data completely.

###Key/Value Operations
SET
Use case: Caching user session information or configuration settings. For example, store a user token with SET session:123 "user_data".

GET
Use case: Retrieve stored configuration or session data. For instance, fetch the user session with GET session:123.

KEYS
Use case: List all keys or keys matching a pattern (e.g., KEYS session:*) to analyze cache usage or to perform maintenance tasks.

TYPE
Use case: Check what type of value is stored at a key—useful when the data structure can vary, such as determining if a key holds a string, list, or hash.

DEL / UNLINK
Use case: Remove keys that are no longer valid. This might be used to evict a stale cache entry after a user logs out or when cleaning up expired data.

EXPIRE
Use case: Set a timeout on keys for caching. For example, cache product details for 3600 seconds so that the cache automatically evicts old data.

RENAME
Use case: When restructuring keys during a migration or data reorganization, use RENAME to change the key’s name without losing its data.
